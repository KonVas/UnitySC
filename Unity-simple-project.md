## Roll a ball tutorial
Roll a ball tutorial is a simple yet insightful project which teaches
you many principles of Unity and we will use it in order to familiarize
ourselves with the platform and its way of working and ecosystem. While
Unity is a very powerful game platform and requires lots of commitment
to study its rich capabilities that would take almost a whole academic
program to master it, we will approach it from a sound designer approach
where we will be able to communicate with SuperCollider via
OSC messages to build interactive audio-visual applications. The project uses `extOSC` to communicate with SuperCollider.
Let's take it a bit slow and take a look on the OSC implementation inside our script.
